# House-Prices-Competition

The Kaggle House Price Competition is a challenge that encourages the application of advanced regression techniques and creative feature engineering to build models that can accurately predict house prices. Participants explore the data, create and engineer features, build models, and submit predictions. The competition is an excellent starting point for practical experience in data science and machine learning. The following link is the official Web page for the kaggle house price competition:

The analysis documented in this notebook resulted in a leaderboard score of 0.126 (rank 869/4527 ). Any score between 0.1 to 0.15 is considered to be a "good" score.

It is a very simple sklearn-xgb-lgbm pipeline with not much EDA ( statistical analysis, removing outliers etc.) and not much tuning.
